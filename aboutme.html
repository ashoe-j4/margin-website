            Hey! My name is Ashritha Chinapaga, but that's a mouthful, so you can call me Ashu. I am in the 7th grade, and have just began HTML coding.
        I like to play video games, watch anime(my favorite is Danganronpa), and listen to music. I have also just taken up photography as another hobby.
        My favorite school subject is science. I have always liked the subject because science gives you the "what" as well as the "why" unlike the other subjects.
        I hope you enjoy these 4 games that I have displayed! I have always been very proud of these games in particular, and I hope they bring you joy!
